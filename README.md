# Two-tier application example

Example that shows how to control the order of service startup with Docker Compose.

# TL;DR

Start both services with:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

You should see output similar to the one below:

```
Starting two-tier-app-example_db_1 ... done
Recreating two-tier-app-example_app_1 ... done
